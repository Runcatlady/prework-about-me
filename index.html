      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>i am a hairstylist and have been for the last 26 years.
        I am the mother of a software engineer and 
        I am now learning to become one myself.
      </p>
      <h1>I am originally from Tacoma, Washington.</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Tacoma, Washington. I left there and moved to California for 4 years, Corvallis, Oregon for 
        4 years, Stafford, Virginia for 2 years, Pensacola, Florida for 2 years and San Diego, California
        for the past 18 years.
      </p>
      <h1>Some of my favorite hobbies are running, biking, yoga, reading the Bible,
        and learning about coding.
      </h1>
      <p>I have run in many organized events, including marathons, half marathons, mud runs, 
        5K's and one ragnar relay and a couple unofficial ultra marathons (1 100K and 1 100miler).

      <h1>At the moment, my dream job is becoming a software engineer.</h1>
      <p> I like the idea of being able to work from home, as well as going to the 
        office. But because of 2020's Covid19 pandemic, working from home really seems 
        ideal. Working as a hairdressser during these times of Covid have proved to be 
        very challenging. Not only is it difficult to make it financially, it is very
        uncomfortable to have to wear a mask all throughout the day while working on clients.
        I don't know how doctors and nurses do it. I have a new respect and appreciation for what they do.
  </p>
      <h1>I live in San Diego, California. 
        
      </h1>
      <p>I have lived in San Diego for the past 18 years. I love it here. </p>
      <h1>Why do I want to be a web developer? Well, like I said earlier, I like the 
        idea of having the flexibility of working from home. And it pays well. I have 
        been an independent contractor for many years now, it sounds nice to work for a 
        company who will take care of me i.e. health insurance and other perks.
