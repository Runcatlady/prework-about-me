      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a hairstylist and have been for the last 26 years.
        I am the mother of a software engineer and 
        I am now learning to become one myself.
      </p>
      <h1>I am originally from Tacoma, Washington.</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Tacoma, Washington. I left there and moved to California for 4 years, Corvallis, Oregon for 
        4 years, Stafford, Virginia for 2 years, Pensacola, Florida for 2 years and San Diego, California
        for the past 18 years.
      </p>
      <h1>Some of my favorite hobbies are running, biking, yoga, reading (especially the Bible),
        and learning about coding.
      </h1>
      <p>I have run in many organized events, including marathons, half marathons, mud runs, and
        5K's. I have participated in one Trail ragnar relay and a couple unofficial ultra marathons (1 100K and 1 100miler).
        I recently started biking and yoga to compliment my running. I have learned that too much of the same 
        activity can put a lot of stress on the same joints and body parts. strengthening all parts
        of the body is important. 

        I have recently finished reading the new testament in the Bible and am currently 
        reading the old testament. I am reading dueteronomy now. The Bible is an amazing 
        read. I definitely recommend starting with the new testament first. The old testament is amazing and 
        rough at times. One of the things I love about the Bible is that it tells ALL. It doesn't hide anything.
        You get the good, the bad, the ugly and the amazing. And it's not fiction, which is why it is so 
        controversial.

      <h1>At the moment, my dream job is becoming a software engineer.</h1>
      <p> Coding is very interesting because you're designing something that can 
          be incredibly beautiful but you, as a coder work in the terminal and what 
          you do there is very "black and white", if you will. It's linear. It is 
          just a bunch of words with some characters strategically placed. But when it's
          all put together correctly and activated you get to see the beauty of all of it's moving
          and non-moving parts. It's really cool!

      <h1>I live in San Diego, California.

      <p>I have lived in San Diego for the past 18 years. I love it here. </p>
      <h1>Why do I want to be a web developer? Well, I like the idea of being able to work from home, as well as going to the 
        office. But because of 2020's Covid19 pandemic, working from home really seems 
        ideal. Working as a hairdressser during these times of Covid have proved to be 
        very challenging. Not only is it difficult to make it financially, it is very
        uncomfortable to have to wear a mask all throughout the day while working on clients.
        I don't know how doctors and nurses do it. I have a new respect and appreciation for what they do. Also, being a web 
        developer/software engineer pays well. I have 
        been an independent contractor for many years now, and it sounds nice to work for a 
        company who will take care of me i.e. health insurance and other perks.

      <p>I love Jesus. He's got my back and he'll have yours if you'll let him.</p>
